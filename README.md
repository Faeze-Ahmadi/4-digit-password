# 4-digit-password

Here's a Python exercise about a cash register code:
We want to open the door of the safe, we do not know the password of the safe, but we have the following information:
The password for the safe is 4 digits
Dividing the third digit by the first digit is 4
The last digit is odd
The last digit of a unit is smaller than its first digit
The first digit is three units smaller than the second digit
Dividing the second digit by the first digit is 2.5
According to the above, what numbers can be the password of the safe?
I wrote code for this program in two separate files, in the first file there is a unique password and we take it from the user as input, and in the second file there is also a unique password, but in the program we determine that the password is printed in a numerical interval.
